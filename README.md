**Factorio Mod ‚Äî Zerg Faction**

This mod introduces a Zerg-inspired alien faction into Factorio, bringing intelligent, swarm-based enemies that behave with tactical coordination similar to the classic sci-fi Zerg concept.

## Features

- **Spawner Clustering:** Groups enemy spawners to coordinate unit spawning in organic clusters.  
- **Dynamic Unit Spawning:** Adjusts the number of spawned units based on spawner density and nearby enemy presence.  
- **Directional Spawning:** Spawners generate units and defenses preferentially towards nearby enemy units for tactical depth.  
- **Spawner Capture Mechanic:** When a designated Zerg unit kills an enemy spawner, the spawner is immediately recreated under the Zerg faction with half health.  
  > *This capture logic is partially inspired by [this-is-mine](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/this-is-mine) ‚Äî thanks to its smart reclaiming concept.*  
- **Multiplayer Support:** Supports multiple Zerg factions simultaneously in multiplayer games.

## Installation

Place the mod files into the `mods` folder of your Factorio installation and enable it in the mod settings.
